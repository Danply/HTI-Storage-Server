# HTI-Storage-Server
This a simple walkthrough to our project, with steps on how to get it installed and running.
The project was done on both Windows OS, and Linux OS, so better to setup a virtual Box for Linux


# Installing Kali Linux

Virtual-Box Download link (106MB): https://download.virtualbox.org/virtualbox/7.0.12/VirtualBox-7.0.12-159484-Win.exe
Kali Linux Pre-built Virtual Machine (3.1GB): https://cdimage.kali.org/kali-2023.4/kali-linux-2023.4-virtualbox-amd64.7z

      - ```
           create Database filehosting;
        ```
   - Verify that you have successfully created a database with this command
         - ```

           cd %userprofile%\Desktop
           mysql -u root -p filehosting < filehosting.sql
        ```
   - this should import the pre built database, to the database you just created.

6. Extract the "file-hosting Website.rar" file to this directory "C:\xampp\htdocs" 
7. Enter the website with this link "http://localhost/file-hosting"

the website should be ready to use at this moment.






# SNORT Installation

1- Extract the "Extract to snort.rar" file to the snort directory "C:\Snort", make sure to Replace all the files "Like this https://i.imgur.com/NFB7Tgq.png"
2- Get your ip, by opening cmd, and typing ``` ipconfig ```, copy the IPV4 "This one https://i.imgur.com/OiMknxY.png"
3- goto "C:\Snort\etc" and open the "snort.conf" with notepad, and replace this ip under the "step #1" with your ip "https://i.imgur.com/QIKNuck.png"
4- install the Npcap 
4- Open cmd, and type the next command 


```
cd c:\Snort\bin
snort -i -1 -c c:\Snort\etc\snort.conf -T
```

It should run with no erros, after that you need to know your Interface that your going to work with, type the next command to find out
```
snort -W
```
you should see different interfaces, but only one with the same IPv4 you entered in the snort.conf before "Example https://i.imgur.com/o2KVZan.png"
Now, you can start the snort tool with this command
```
cd c:\Snort\bin
snort -i 1 -c c:\Snort\etc\snort.conf -A console
```
make sure that this part "snort -i 1" is the same number as your interface.
Now snort is running, and waiting for packets to analyze.
